# Upwork Introduction to Projects

Assume that phase I of the following projects need to be completed by end of September, all these projects are part of a much bigger Proxy/ICAP related project we have at Glasswall (these are the Open Source components that we can easily add resources without needing to onboard the Upwork talent into out internal systems (Jira, Slack, Jupyter notebooks, etc..)

The list of projects and initial briefs can be reviewed here: https://github.com/filetrust/Open-Source/blob/master/upwork-project-briefs.md

**Here is the list of projects:**
https://github.com/filetrust/k8-glasswall-rebuild
https://github.com/filetrust/k8-data-visualization

All work done for the projects defined below are to be released under the Apache 2.0 Open Source license. 
Tech Stack:
* Python, NodeJS or Golang for backend code
* React for frontend code

## How to communicate effectively your understanding of the project:
* This is an example that you can use as a reference when you need to communicate the details of the project or an idea: https://github.com/filetrust/k8-glasswall-rebuild/tree/master/upwork-devs/a-khaledf
* Start with a top level diagram of the task at hand
* Add flow-diagram / flow-chart that shows in detail the multiple steps.
* Add descriptions and comments about the flow-diagram steps (to provide more context and explain thinking)
* Add FAQ section with explicit questions and answers (avoid ambiguity)
* Ask for 'honest feedback' on channel
* The diagrams and flows don't have to be perfect and corrections will be made, but this is an example of a great start. It allows everyone to understand better, provide feedback and work as a team.
