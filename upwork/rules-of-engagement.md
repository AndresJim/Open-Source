# Upwork Rules of Engagement (for these projects)
  
 - All work done for the projects defined below are to be released under the Apache 2.0 Open Source license
 - All work and conversation threads to be public (on GitHub or Slack)
    - There is no direct (i.e. private) support. 
    - Part of the exercise is to see how Upwork resources are able to: 
      - a) work independently 
      - b) collaborate effectively (namely with other Upwork resources)
 - These projects are used to evaluate new Upwork resources 
 - At times, there will be multiple Upwork resources working on the same tasks
 - Each Upwork resource is allocated (via the Upwork UI) a number of hours to work on these projects (which represents the maximum that Glasswall will pay for the work done)
 - Tech Stack:
    - Python,  NodeJS or Golang for backend code
    - React for frontend code
    - Jupyter Notebooks
    - AWS lambda or Azure Serverless functions
    - Git
    - GitHub Actions
    - Markdown
 - We encourage innovation and creative thinking, so please fell free to show alternative technologies, workflows and visualizations

 ## FAQ

 **Q: Why is the first contract for 
 10h?"**

 A: Because that is the evaluation period for every Upwork Resource that we hire. If all goes well we will change the Upwork contract to have more hours
