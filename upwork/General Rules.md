# ### Upwork general Rules

In Glasswall, we want to create an amazing productive environment, where communication and situational awareness is absolutely key. Please see this presentation from @Luke Robbertse (Glasswall) on how we use Upwork Resources at Glasswall https://www.slideshare.net/LukeRobbertse/how-we-use-upwork-at-glasswall

Note that in the first week, only 10 hours will be assigned and hours will be increased based on deliverables and culture fit. In these 10 hours, we want to see you in action and see how you are able to take a direction/idea/request and effectively execute it. Every week your performance will be evaluated and hours can be increased to 25 or 40, depending also on your availability. 

Please be proactive, ask questions, take on tasks, make mistakes, learn and help us to move a particular task in the right direction.

## Some general rules:
* Remember that we are working across multiple time zones.
* All tasks should be documented in the correct project in GitHub.
* For PMs:  every time somebody uses the  (task icon) in a channel , that means that a GitHub issue for that task to be created. Be proactive and pick the tasks where you are a good fit. 
* Please feel free to propose ideas on how we should be operating and how to make things better.
* Be proactive at finding areas and tasks that you want to focus on. We want to make sure we create the best environment for you to be successful and leverage your skills and talents).
* At times, there will be multiple Upwork resources working on the same tasks.
* Each Upwork resource is allocated (via the Upwork UI) a number of hours to work on these projects (which represents the maximum that Glasswall will pay for the work done)
* We encourage innovation and creative thinking, so please feel free to show alternative technologies, workflows and visualizations.
* Part of the exercise is to see how Upwork resources are able to:
* a) work independently
* b) collaborate effectively (namely with other Upwork resources)
